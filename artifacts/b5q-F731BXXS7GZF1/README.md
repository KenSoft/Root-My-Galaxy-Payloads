# Galaxy Z Flip5 SM-F731B (F731BXXS7GZF1) payload

Exact firmware: `F731BXXS7GZF1`, kernel
`5.15.189-android13-8-33404244-abF731BXXS7GZF1` (`android13-5.15`).

The ADB-shell tracefs route, root bootstrap, KernelSU v3.2.5 late-load, and
Shizuku-free app route were hardware-validated on 2026-09-22 and 2026-09-23.
The app completes on-device without a PC or Shizuku, with SELinux Enforcing
and the official Manager connected. It uses fresh P0 discovery with 4K
slide-fingerprint coverage. See the
[validation record](../../docs/SM-F731B-F731BXXS7GZF1.md).

The current app library is an adaptive reliability candidate. The experimental
`256/32/4` KernelSnitch profile produced no successful controlled-mm leaks on
the Flip5 and is now opt-in, avoiding its failed setup before every working
`256/128/8` measurement. The target's collision counts, confirmations,
exact-address search, and page grouping are unchanged. Gate, probe, and restore
now perform one MCAST operation at a time. Gate state is always read back, and
probe misses use non-destructive `tee` snapshots: only an exact unchanged
marker permits another attempt, using a different fake waiter bank. Changed,
ambiguous, and I/O-error states fail closed. FOPS retries now use the observed
`misc_fops` value rather than the race child's status, and recoverable pipe/root
errors execute their rollback paths instead of exiting from the logger.
The retained P0 keeper now backs off from 10 ms polling to at most one root
socket attempt per second, then transfers only the three stabilizing FDs to
the UID-0 `cve43499-roothold` process and exits. The payload now requires that
holder to become ready before it reports root success. This avoids both the audit
storm and the regressed permanent app-domain keeper, which retained unrelated
reclaim sockets and queued SKBs after a successful exploit. KernelSnitch keeps
the hardware-proven direct futex-wait timing; cleanup changes the target value
before wake so a late waiter cannot sleep after the wake. Pipe-stage progress
checkpoints and checked/EINTR-safe result handling remain enabled.
The preserved RWC156 crash record confirms the regression: init killed the
successful run's P0 keeper PID 16793 and stability keeper PID 13471; 84 ms
after the second kill the allocator found refcount -1, followed by a
`clear_page` panic 2.50 seconds after the first kill.
The app now permits a third *fresh-page* P0 fallback after two exact clean
oracle misses. Each fallback discards the previous pipe oracle and controlled
page, then rebuilds both before performing one MCAST write. It never retries a
writer on the same reclaimed page; the gate2 experiment was reverted after
RWC157 proved that unsafe. The third search is reached only on the two-miss
tail and recently costs roughly 2--3 additional minutes.
Compact P0-page reuse remains compiled behind `RMG_P0_PAGE_REUSE=1`, but is
disabled by default and no enabled reuse binary is published in the feed.

The published app payload library enables `APP_REQUIRE_FRESH_P0_SESSION`,
matching the personal feed's fresh-session profile. The root helper was rebuilt with Android NDK r29,
API 35, and is byte-identical to the hardware-tested file. The KernelSU pair
is the newer hardware-validated revision with both
[SELinux hiding](../../docs/SM-F731B-selinux-hide.md) and
[su compatibility](../../docs/SM-F731B-sucompat.md) fixes. It replaces the
userspace frontend and overlay workaround.

Selected [validation outputs](validation/) record the final module's
firmware audit, authorized/denied `su` behavior, and SELinux hiding regression.

An earlier app library's 64K slide table omitted the validating run's
`0x178000` slide. Its logged P0 sample scores 8/8 against the exact local
kernel image with runner-up 0 in this 4K table (the old table scores 0/8).
The physical alias is therefore confirmed. An intermediate app-domain run
accumulated
the full 32-entry controlled-mm group in both stages (47 attempts for P0 and
85 for FOPS); the logged 0–3 collision messages are per-attempt misses, not the
final group size. It completed P0 discovery and prepared the FOPS page, then
stopped during the FOPS PI handoff before the phone rebooted.

The route audit found that `APP_CLOSED_FOPS_ROUTE` prepares its fake lock,
task, parent, and target for the new `PAGE_PAYLOAD_FOPS` page, but the fresh-P0
trigger then called `select_slide_payload_index(0)`. That selector still
described the earlier `PAGE_PAYLOAD_SLIDE` page and overwrote the new route
state. The fixed closed route now keeps the fields prepared for the FOPS page,
and the subsequent baseline build completed the full app-domain root and
KernelSU handoff on hardware.

## Build

```sh
make TARGET=b5q-F731BXXS7GZF1 ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/android-ndk-r29 all
```

`all` builds the standalone and app payloads, the root helper with
`--allow-shell` selected for the initial late-load.
The shared Makefile's fixed-size `release` target is still capped at 104128
bytes, which is too small for this target's expanded fingerprint table. The
published app library is the regular build with fresh-P0 enforcement and the
expanded 4K fingerprint table.

## Integration status

- Validation covers ADB-shell and direct app-domain execution on this exact
  firmware without Shizuku. The three-page/holder candidate is build-validated,
  but its timing, post-root stability, and repeated-run reliability remain
  pending.
- The exact `0xa8000000` physical alias is confirmed by the latest P0 sample
  at slide `0x178000`; the baseline completed end-to-end app-domain root.
- The app defaults directly to the working conservative KernelSnitch profile.
  Set `RMG_CONTROLLED_FAST=1` only for shell-driven experiments with the
  unsuccessful `256/32/4` profile. Page reuse is also opt-in with
  `RMG_P0_PAGE_REUSE=1`; keep it disabled for reliability testing. The
  `cve-2026-43499-app-p0-reliable.so` file is the historical repeated-write
  candidate; use `cve-2026-43499-app-baseline.so` for the hardware-validated
  binary rollback.
- Kernel `su_compat` supplies the conventional `su` path for authorized UIDs
  without a real `/system/bin/su` file or `/system/bin` overlay. Use a fresh
  boot when upgrading from the old overlay-based build and do not restore
  that overlay.
- Root and the late-loaded module are per-boot. Select `--allow-shell` on the
  initial load; the recorded unload/reload experiment hung the device.
