/*
 * BLOCKER: the pselect fake-lock route cannot work on this kernel as-is.
 *
 * The route relies on core_sys_select's on-stack fd_set copies landing on top
 * of the stale rt_mutex_waiter left by futex_wait_requeue_pi. Measuring both
 * call chains from the syscall entry SP (S):
 *
 *   pselect  __arm64_sys_pselect6 0xa0 + core_sys_select 0x1c0 = 0x260
 *            stack_fds at sp+0x50   -> S-0x210 .. S-0x110  (0x100 bytes)
 *   futex    __arm64_sys_futex 0x80 + do_futex 0x140
 *                                   + futex_wait_requeue_pi 0x1b0 = 0x370
 *            rt_waiter candidates   -> S-0x2d8 .. S-0x368
 *
 * The waiter sits at least 0xc8 bytes BELOW the fd_set buffer, so the copied
 * fd_sets never reach it. The kernel then walks stale stack contents as an
 * rb-tree, which is the observed panic.
 *
 * The same computation on S25 CZF1 (6.6) puts the waiter at sp+0x90 = S-0x200
 * and stack_fds at sp+0x80 = S-0x200 -- coincident, i.e. SHIFT 0, matching the
 * value that profile actually uses. The model is therefore calibrated.
 *
 * The difference is do_futex's frame: 0x140 here versus 0x60 on 6.6, which
 * pushes the waiter ~0xe0 deeper while the pselect side is unchanged.
 *
 * No SLIDE_PSELECT_WORD_SHIFT value fixes this -- it would have to be about
 * -25 words, and the in/out/ex logical array is only 15 words at nfds=320.
 * A larger nfds does not help either: the buffer base stays at sp+0x50 and
 * grows upward, away from the waiter, and beyond 6*FDS_BYTES > 256 the kernel
 * switches to kmalloc and leaves the stack entirely.
 *
 * rt_waiter's location is not a guess: futex_wait_requeue_pi passes
 * `add x3, sp, #0x98` immediately before `bl rt_mutex_slowlock_block`, whose
 * 4th argument is the waiter (x27 is loaded with the same address earlier).
 *
 * Survey of alternative spray vehicles on this kernel:
 *
 *   pselect6  sys 0xa0 + core_sys_select 0x1c0 = 0x260
 *             stack_fds sp+0x50 -> S-0x210 .. S-0x110   too shallow by 0xc8
 *   select    sys 0x80 + core_sys_select 0x1c0 = 0x240  shallower still
 *   writev    do_writev 0x120, iovstack sp+0x38 -> ~S-0xe8   far too shallow
 *   recvmsg   ____sys_recvmsg 0xf0, iovstack sp+0x90 -> ~S-0x100  too shallow
 *   ppoll     sys 0x80 + do_sys_poll 0x3f0 = 0x470
 *             stack_pps sp+0x70, struct poll_list {next; int len;
 *             entries[]} so entries at sp+0x7c, 30 (N_STACK_PPS) x 8 bytes
 *             -> S-0x3f4 .. S-0x304                     too DEEP by 0x2c
 *
 * (sp+0x170 in do_sys_poll is the 624-byte struct poll_wqueues, memset at
 * entry -- not the pollfd buffer.)
 *
 * The waiter falls in the GAP between the pselect buffer above it and the
 * ppoll buffer below it -- but sendmmsg DOES reach it:
 *
 *   sendmmsg  __arm64_sys_sendmmsg 0x10 (stp x29,x30,[sp,#-0x10]! -- a
 *             PRE-INDEXED prologue, easy to miss when only grepping for
 *             `sub sp`) + __sys_sendmmsg 0x160 + ___sys_sendmsg 0x1a0 = 0x310
 *             iovstack sp+0x48 (proved: `add x8, sp, #0x48; str x8, [sp]`
 *             i.e. iov = iovstack), 8 x sizeof(struct iovec) = 128 bytes
 *             -> S-0x2c8 .. S-0x248
 *
 *   waiter    S-0x2d8 .. S-0x280
 *   overlap   S-0x2c8 .. S-0x280  = 0x48 of the waiter's 0x58 bytes
 *
 * struct iovec is {void *iov_base; size_t iov_len} -- both fully controlled
 * 64-bit values with no kernel writeback, and __import_iovec copies the user
 * array in before validating it, so even an EFAULT/EINVAL call leaves the
 * data in place. That covers waiter offsets 0x10..0x50: tree_entry.rb_left,
 * the whole pi_tree_entry, task, lock, wake_state/prio, deadline and ww_ctx.
 *
 * Not covered: tree_entry.__rb_parent_color (0x00) and tree_entry.rb_right
 * (0x08). Those land on ___sys_sendmsg's sp+0x38 / sp+0x40; the function
 * zeroes sp+0x8..0x38 on entry, so 0x00 is most likely 0 rather than junk.
 *
 * remove_waiter() erases BOTH trees -- rt_mutex_dequeue() via tree_entry and
 * rt_mutex_dequeue_pi() via pi_tree_entry -- so tree_entry does not need to
 * be useful, but it does need to be benign:
 *
 *   waiter+0x00 tree_entry.__rb_parent_color = ___sys_sendmsg sp+0x38.
 *     ZEROED: the block at eb34..eb40 clears sp+0x8..0x40 before
 *     __copy_msghdr_from_user (stp xzr,xzr,[sp,#0x30] covers 0x30-0x3f).
 *     parent == NULL, so __rb_change_child writes into the real
 *     lock->waiters.rb_node. Harmless.
 *
 *   waiter+0x08 tree_entry.rb_right = sp+0x40. Also benign, by inheritance.
 *     The ONLY instructions touching sp+0x40..0x47 in ___sys_sendmsg are
 *     `str wzr,[sp,#0x44]` and `ldr w2,[sp,#0x44]` -- the upper dword only.
 *     sp+0x40..0x43 is never written, so the slot keeps whatever the previous
 *     stack occupant left. That occupant is the futex chain: sp+0x40 is
 *     absolute S-0x2d0, which is futex_wait_requeue_pi's sp+0xa0, i.e.
 *     waiter+0x08 -- tree_entry.rb_right itself. rb_link_node() sets
 *     rb_left = rb_right = NULL on enqueue, so it is 0.
 *
 *     Nothing overwrites it in between: __arm64_sys_sendmmsg (S-0x10) and
 *     __sys_sendmmsg (S-0x170) are shallower than S-0x2d0; ___sys_sendmsg's
 *     callees allocate below S-0x310; and the futex return path only restores
 *     registers. (Assumes the waiter is a leaf, i.e. sole waiter on the
 *     rt_mutex, which the exploit arranges.)
 *
 * (The x29-relative `stp xzr` block near function entry clears
 * sp+0xc8..0x148, a different structure above iovstack, not this one.)
 *
 * A single-vehicle sendmsg route is impossible: to make sendmsg dwell (block
 * in the send path) its iov_base must pass access_ok as a user address, but
 * iov_base IS the planted value and the waiter is full of kernel pointers --
 * mutually exclusive. That dead end is resolved by NOT needing sendmsg to
 * dwell; the combined-vehicle route below plants via a FAILING sendmmsg and
 * dwells via pselect. See that note for details.
 *
 * Frame sizes were verified: every function in both chains uses a plain
 * `sub sp, sp, #imm` prologue (no pre-indexed stp), and the waiter offset is
 * confirmed from two independent call sites -- rt_mutex_wait_proxy_lock
 * (arg 3) and rt_mutex_cleanup_proxy_lock (arg 2) on 6.6, and
 * rt_mutex_slowlock_block (arg 4) on 5.15. The same model reproduces the
 * shipping S25 CZF1 value (SHIFT 0) exactly, so it is calibrated.
 */

/*
 * COMBINED-VEHICLE ROUTE. pselect's fd_set buffer is 0xc8 too shallow to
 * reach the waiter (see the long note above), but the waiter at S-0x2d8 also
 * sits BELOW pselect's whole 0x260 frame -- so pselect never overwrites it.
 * That lets us plant the fake waiter with one syscall and dwell with another:
 *
 *   PLANT  sendmmsg with a kernel-pointer iovec. iovec_from_user copies the
 *          array to iovstack (S-0x2c8) BEFORE access_ok rejects it, so the
 *          -EFAULT return leaves waiter qwords 2..10 on the kernel stack.
 *   DWELL  pselect (empty sets, timeout). Its frame bottoms at S-0x260,
 *          above the waiter, so the plant survives the whole sleep.
 *   FIRE   the existing sched_setattr consumer walks the intact waiter.
 *
 * iovstack sits at waiter+0x10, so it covers qwords 2..10. Mapping (iovstack
 * is struct iovec[]{void*base; size_t len}, both raw-copied):
 *   iov[0] = { waiter[2]=tree_left,  waiter[3]=pi_pc   }
 *   iov[1] = { waiter[4]=pi_right=0, waiter[5]=pi_left }
 *   iov[2] = { waiter[6]=task,       waiter[7]=lock    }
 *   iov[3] = { waiter[8]=state+prio, waiter[9]=0       }
 *   iov[4] = { waiter[10]=ww_ctx=0,  pad               }
 *
 * STATUS (on-device, iterated): the route is built and the plant is confirmed
 * to execute --
 *   - socketpair(AF_UNIX,SOCK_DGRAM) succeeds (diagnostic logs sock fd);
 *   - sendmmsg reaches __import_iovec; iovec_from_user's native _copy_from_user
 *     runs BEFORE the post-copy EINVAL return, so the 5-iovec residue lands on
 *     iovstack at S-0x2c8 (waiter+0x10).
 * Two real bugs in the approach were found and fixed:
 *   1. tree_entry qword1 (rb_right, uninitialised) is zeroed by a priming
 *      ppoll (do_sys_poll memsets S-0x300..S-0x90) before the plant.
 *   2. pselect is NOT a usable dwell: it sleeps inside do_select, whose 0x3c0
 *      frame (SP at S-0x620) engulfs the waiter and overwrites the plant.
 *      nanosleep is used instead (frame 0x150, SP at S-0x150, above the
 *      waiter), so the plant survives the sleep.
 *
 * DESPITE all that it still panics during the sched_setattr PI-walk. The
 * remaining uncontrolled value is qword0 (tree_entry.__rb_parent_color): the
 * combine forces it to 0 (___sys_sendmsg's msghdr clear), whereas the working
 * pselect route sets it to slide_oracle_parent. Whether the walk needs it, or
 * whether the panic is elsewhere (write-target validity, an rt_mutex internal
 * that differs from 6.6), cannot be distinguished without kernel-side panic
 * observability -- which needs root, the very thing this produces. Blind
 * reboot-iteration has poor expected value past this point.
 *
 * Both resume ideas were then checked and BOTH fail:
 *   (a) sp+0x38 is NOT a msghdr field -- ___sys_sendmsg's kernel msghdr
 *       (msg_sys) is at sp+0xc8 (S-0x248); sp+0x38 is zeroed scratch. So
 *       sendmsg args cannot set qword0.
 *   (b) no vehicle covers waiter+0 (S-0x2d8) while also covering waiter+0x10:
 *       recvmsg iovstack lands at S-0x2a8 (too shallow), sendmmsg at S-0x2c8
 *       (waiter+0x10), recvmmsg at S-0x348 (too deep). The waiter's first
 *       qword sits in the gap, and any second planter deep enough to write it
 *       also passes through S-0x2c8 and clobbers the sendmmsg plant. sendmmsg
 *       itself always zeroes qword0 (msghdr clear), so it cannot be preserved
 *       from a prior write either.
 *
 * VMEMMAP_START was also checked and is correct: -(1 << (VA_BITS - 6)) =
 * 0xfffffffe00000000 for both 5.15 and 6.6 (STRUCT_PAGE_MAX_SHIFT is a fixed
 * compile-time 6 on both), so slide_oracle_parent's page-struct address is
 * sound. And the waiter offset S-0x2d8 is confirmed from remove_waiter's
 * arg2 (x1 = sp+0x98), not just the slowlock_block call.
 *
 * FINAL CONCLUSION (derived from the kernel disassembly, not the device):
 *
 * Reading rt_mutex_adjust_pi + rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain and the fake_lock
 * construction (util.c) shows the write primitive IS the stack waiter's
 * tree_entry erase: __rb_erase_augmented -> __rb_change_child writes
 *   *(tree_entry.__rb_parent_color + child_off) = tree_entry.rb_left
 * i.e. *(qword0 + 0x10|0x18) = qword2. qword0 is the write DESTINATION, the
 * core of the primitive -- not incidental. In the PAGE_PAYLOAD_SLIDE mode
 * that P0_ONLY exercises, fake_lock->owner is SLIDE_LOCK_OWNER_VALUE (1),
 * which rt_mutex_owner masks to NULL, so the chain never propagates to an
 * owner and the pi_tree_entry reroute (which would use qword3, controllable)
 * never fires. There is no alternate write path in this mode.
 *
 * Therefore the exploit requires controlling the waiter's FIRST qword, and on
 * this 5.15 stack geometry that qword (S-0x2d8) is unreachable: it sits 0x10
 * above sendmmsg's iovstack (S-0x2c8, the deepest usable copy-and-return
 * plant), sendmmsg zeroes it via the msghdr clear, and no other vehicle
 * covers waiter+0 while remaining usable (recvmsg iovstack S-0x2a8 too
 * shallow, recvmmsg S-0x348 too deep). Setting tree_left=fake_w0 makes the
 * tree_entry erase non-corrupting but leaves the primitive unfired, and the
 * run still panics -- so qword0 is load-bearing beyond just tree consistency.
 *
 * This is a definitive negative result for the pselect stack-overlay route:
 * its write destination lives in the one waiter qword this kernel's syscall
 * stack frames put out of reach. It is not a negative result for the target as
 * a whole: the MCAST writer below reaches the deeper waiter and is the current
 * hardware-verified route. The combined route remains documented
 * here as a record of the earlier analysis, but is deliberately not enabled. */
